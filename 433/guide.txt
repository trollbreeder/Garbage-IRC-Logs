You wanna sniff sum nice shit bro? HAVE A GAME GUIDE ON MATT SIMULATOR (Note: this is for the 2k18 patch, anything may be outdated)

PART 0: MAKING UR METT
When you boot up the game, you will see "new", "load", "settings" and "exit". If you need to configure settings, hit the settings button

Click on the new button. The load button is greyed out so that /dev/null/ won't get read.

You will see a cutscene where matt opens up edityourself.com. edit your matt as long as you like.

Give your mett a name and click "done".

A cutscene will play, and matt will be the one you made on edityourself.com.

This is the main game. The camera focuses on the computer. Welcome to the game.

PART 1: BEING MATT

PART 1A: Fixing bugz

Once in a while, some twat has a bug. you'll get a notification. Now, reply to the dumbass.

replying to the idiot will make you analyze the bug, and then reply with "ITS NOT A BUG" if it isn't a bug. If it is, then

you will fix the bug, stopping other pushovers from talking about it. Fixing critical bugs will get you sum YAY points.

you level up with YAY points, thus getting a bigger community.

PART 1B: Guidez

When you get enough "i can't get this to work" notifications, you get to write a guide, reducing the amount of that type of notification.

you will be able to set the EFFORT meter from 1 to 6, making guides longer or shorter depending on the EFFORT.
Mashing keyboard minigame: you mash the keyboard in order to write the guide, and to log into your account.
This will be longer if your EFFORT is higher.

PART 2: Upgrading yo mett

to upgrade your matt (Better keyboard, STROBE LIGHTS, stronger arms, debug tools, donations), you'll have to spend some DOSH $$$

you get DOSH from hacknet sales and (once unlocked) donations. YEEY

Better keyboard: A better keyboard equals more words per minute, meaning guides will be faster

STROBE LIGHTS: Includes some funky beats YO! Cosmetic, but for one thing: MATT WILL FIX BUGS FASTER AND MAKE GUIDES FASTER WHOOOO

Stronger arms: Matt types faster, meaning guides will be faster. way faster than getting better keyboards.

Debug tools: More debugging tools, which means fixing bugs faster! But there will be more bugs detected because people need debug tools, too.

Donations: unlocks donations, which means more DOSH! which means your getting DOSH for DOSH.

PART 3: Le sales

Sales will go up and down a few times. with more RESPECT means more SALES, which means more DOSH.

Making DLC will make the Sales go through the roof, with more content, exploits and tools, which unfortunately means more bugs.

yearly, PAX will go on, making sales way more through the roof when new DLC in works is presented there.

PART 4: SUGGESTIONS 'n' IDEAS

Suggestions are community ideas which may be useful for some extension developers. your RESPECT and YAY points will go up when you make these, but unfortunately more bugs.

Ideas are just things that pop into your head that may be useful, but weren't thought up. With luck, your RESPECT and YAY will go up, but not always.

PART 5: HOW TO GET TO THE END, and WINNING

All things must end, unfortunately.

When your DOSH, RESPECT and LEVEL are at 100, aliens will take over earth, in which you must brainwash these aliens with your cool game, and banish them to space.

You will get several ideas, most of them trash, but if you get a BRAINWASH idea, use it. The aliens will be defeated and the credits will roll.

PART 6: some cool shit, bro (not crack cocaine)

CTRL G on that motherfucking game, and you'll see a "ENTER PASSWORD" screen. Enter the cheatcode in the credits (aliensdid911) and you shall be given access to the cheats.

PART 6A: The cheats

DOSH DOSH DOSH: Get infinite DOSH, bro!

Instant Aliens: Sets DOSH, RESPECT and LEVEL to 100 and thus triggers the aliens.

Everything is free!: everything is 0 DOSH (0 $$$)

Insert sonic reference here: GOTTA GO FAST: you fix bugs and write guides and make suggestions/ideas at the speed of light.

Ya like jazz?: Changes music to smoothjazz.mp3 and makes your matt dance. Additionally, some other objects just dance. Also, your poster in the background will change to a bee movie poster.

Idea generator: Makes some random idea enter into your mind.

Idea maker: Asks you for an idea, then puts the idea into your mind.

Dream's Deep: Puts a shit ton of ideas into your head, usually referencing to muigi's thoughts in Lario and Muigi: Team Dream. BIG BRO!

PART 6B: Easter eggs

1. Enter CTRL + W and you'll open up a tab on your metts pc. 

here are some websites
edityourself.com - Edits your matt again
illuminati.com - a conspiracy?
moodel.com - Search up shit
cracknet-os.com - Cracknet yo!
matt.com - MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT MATT
kaguya.com - Disable tracking, which causes the credits to roll :p
credits.com - A copy of the credits, great for rereading something you couldn't read!
music.com - A lot of music to play.

Possibly more sites are in here!

2. If your sales goes through 2000, your background changes to starfield2!

3. Progressily, your files get cluttered in the (not necessary) files section. there will be irc logs and data chunks, similar to cracknet

4. If the game is pirated, the game instantly fires random bursts of corruption at the game, causing glitches nobody else had seen.

PART 7: The end

Thats it, thats all of matt simulator patch 2k18. Thanks.

just a quote from the update
"Cuz if we rerelease it every year people will turn into mewto's and face us in a pokemon battle which is totally unfair"

hah, suck my dick, company who made matt the game (your being secret about your company name), cuz i'm being paid to spoil everyone.

NGI PLEASE GIVE ME MY SALARY ALREADY, WHERE'S MY 50 DOLLARS PAYSAFE???? I HAVE TO FUEL MY GAMING ADDICTION
