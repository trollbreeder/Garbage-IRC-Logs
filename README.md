# Garbage-IRC-Logs
IRC Logs that can be used for misc purposes in hacknet extensions, or be read for entertainment.

Each folder holds a part of irc logs. All folder numbers are based on hacknet port numbers.

There can be other stuff than irc logs in a folder, but they MUST be non commercial or dont have important info in them.
