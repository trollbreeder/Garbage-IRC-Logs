<trollbreeder> angery koop
<trollbreeder> **angery koop**

<trollbreeder> he needs to go to the hospital
<trollbreeder> or else he'll get QPU misaligned
<Fyt03> @trollbreeder And then he'll need to build up speed for 12 hours to get back
<trollbreeder> but there are no objects in a PU
<trollbreeder> so he'll be stuck there
<trollbreeder> unless a doctor saves him
<Fyt03> You don't need objects to build up speed
<trollbreeder> but i dont think he has enough speed to get alligned and back into the real map again 
<trollbreeder> plus, without objects, he can't build up speed fast enough
<trollbreeder> quick, put him on a PU threadmill
<trollbreeder> a special threadmill with a pedro spot on it so that koop can get qpu alligned
